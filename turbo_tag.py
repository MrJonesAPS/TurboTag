Module: Turbo Tag Game Simulation

This module simulates a game of Turbo Tag, a dynamic team sport emphasizing strategy and agility. 
It is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end, involving two teams with a variable number of players. 
The primary objective is to score points through tagging, ball possession, and goal scoring.

Game Rules:

1. Team Composition: Teams can have 5 to 9 players. Each additional player beyond five reduces the team's total band count by 2.
2. Starting the Game: Begins with a jump ball at the center. The team that secures the ball gains initial possession.
3. Scoring Points:

   - Goal Score: Throwing the ball into the opponent's goal scores 3 points.
   - Band Capture: Tagging an opponent allows stealing a band, earning 1 point. If the tagged player holds bands of more than one color, 
     the tagging player steals a band of their own team's color. The tagger only steals a band of the opposing team's color if the tagged player 
     has only bands of that color.
   - End of game bonuses, described below.

4. Tagging Mechanism:

   - Players can tag opponents to steal their bands.
   - A player must wait at least 30 seconds before re-tagging the same opponent.
   - If a tagged player holds the ball, the ball is transferred to the nearest opponent. If this tag occurs within 5 meters of the tagging 
     player's team's goal, the tag is also worth one point (this is called a "block-by-tag").

5. Time Limit: Two 25-minute halves with a break in between.
6. Scoring System:

   - Each goal: 3 points.
   - Each band captured: 1 point.
   - Bonus for capturing all opponent bands: At the end of the game, each player that has zero bands of their own color awards their opponent 10 points.
   - Single color bonus: At the end of the game, each band that a team holds of their opposing team's color is worth an additional bonus point.
